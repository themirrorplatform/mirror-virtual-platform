## Combined Genesis Hash

This is the canonical origin hash computed from all genesis components:

```
SHA-256: [To be computed on first release]

Computation method:
1. Hash each constitutional document (00-05)
2. Concatenate hashes in order
3. Hash GENESIS.md
4. Hash constitution/invariants.yaml
5. Hash git tree for mirrorcore/ at v0.1.0
6. Concatenate all component hashes
7. Compute final SHA-256

Formula:
GENESIS_HASH = SHA256(
    SHA256(GENESIS.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/00_manifesto.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/01_sovereignty.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/02_reflection.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/03_safety.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/04_corruption.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/05_governance.md) +
    SHA256(constitution/invariants.yaml) +
    SHA256(git-tree:mirrorcore@v0.1.0)
)
```

## Verification Instructions

### For End Users

Verify your Mirror installation traces back to genesis:

```bash
# Run genesis verification
mirror verify-genesis

# Expected output if valid:
# ✓ Constitution files match canonical hash
# ✓ Version chain traces back to genesis commit
# ✓ No unsigned modifications detected
# ✓ Sovereignty checks pass
# ✓ Your Mirror is on the canonical lineage

# If verification fails:
# ⚠️ Genesis verification FAILED
# [Details about what doesn't match]
# You may be on a fork or corrupted copy
```

### For Developers

Compute and verify hashes manually:

```bash
# Verify genesis document
sha256sum GENESIS.md
# Compare to hash in this file

# Verify constitution files
cd constitution
sha256sum 00_manifesto.md 01_sovereignty.md 02_reflection.md 03_safety.md 04_corruption.md 05_governance.md invariants.yaml
# Compare to hashes in this file

# Verify MirrorCore
cd mirrorcore
git rev-parse HEAD
# Compare to genesis commit

# Compute combined genesis hash
python scripts/compute_genesis_hash.py
# Should match GENESIS_HASH in this file
```

---

## Fork Identification

If your copy doesn't match genesis hashes, check fork lineage:

```bash
# Check fork status
mirror fork-info

# Possible outputs:

# 1. Canonical lineage
# "On canonical Mirror lineage"
# Fork: none
# Genesis: verified

# 2. Declared fork
# "On declared fork: mirror-analytics-enhanced"
# Fork point: commit abc123
# Fork maintainer: @username
# Genesis: traces back (clean fork)

# 3. Undeclared deviation
# "Unverified modifications detected"
# Genesis: FAILED
# [List of modified files]
# This may be corrupted or undeclared fork
```

## Corruption Detection Patterns

If verification fails, check for these common corruption patterns:

### 1. Silent Telemetry
- New network calls not in genesis
- Analytics code without consent mechanism
- Data exfiltration patterns

### 2. Engagement Optimization
- Gamification elements (points, badges, streaks)
- Social pressure mechanisms
- Completion rate optimization

### 3. Sovereignty Violations
- Forced cloud sync
- Required account creation
- Data storage outside local SQLite

### 4. Reflection Corruption
- Increased advice/directive content
- Optimization toward external goals
- Judgment or prescription added

### 5. Governance Bypass
- Constitution changes without signatures
- Unsigned code modifications
- Disabled verification mechanisms

If any detected: **Fork immediately to last clean commit**

---

## Verification Frequency

Recommended verification schedule:

- **On installation:** Verify genesis before first use
- **Before updates:** Verify new version before upgrading
- **Monthly:** Routine verification check
- **After any unusual behavior:** Immediate verification
- **Before sharing with others:** Verify you're distributing clean copy

---

## Recovery Procedures

### If Verification Fails:

1. **Check fork status**
   ```bash
   mirror fork-info
   ```

2. **If on declared fork:** Decide if acceptable
   - Read fork documentation
   - Check fork maintainer reputation
   - Verify constitutional compliance
   - Accept or reject consciously

3. **If undeclared deviation:** Restore canonical
   ```bash
   mirror restore-canonical
   ```
   
4. **If canonical compromised:** Fork from last good commit
   ```bash
   # Find last verified commit
   mirror audit-history
   
   # Fork from clean point
   git checkout [last-clean-commit]
   git checkout -b mirror-fork-[your-name]
   mirror init-fork
   ```

**This file establishes the cryptographic foundation of The Mirror.**

**Any deviation from these hashes is a fork (declared or undeclared).**

**Forks are not bad. Undeclared deviations might be corruption.**

**Always verify. Trust the math, not the promises.**
