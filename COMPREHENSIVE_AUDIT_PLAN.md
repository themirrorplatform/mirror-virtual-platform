# Mirror Platform: Comprehensive Audit & Review Plan

## Scope
- All advanced security, trust, and resilience features (distributed trust/PKI, multi-signature, HSM abstraction, ZKP/confidentiality, anomaly detection, secure transport, quorum, key recovery, formal verification, secure network propagation)
- All protocol invariants, cryptographic operations, and consensus logic
- All audit logs, anomaly hooks, and recovery flows

## Steps
1. **Internal Review**
   - Review all code, tests, and documentation for correctness, coverage, and clarity
   - Run full test suite, fuzz, chaos, and property-based tests
   - Review audit logs and anomaly alerts for completeness
2. **External Security Audit**
   - Engage independent security firm(s) to review code, protocol, and cryptography
   - Provide all documentation, test results, and formal specs
   - Address all findings and recommendations
3. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Launch responsible disclosure and bug bounty program
   - Publicize scope, rewards, and process
   - Integrate findings into continuous improvement
4. **Ongoing Review**
   - Schedule periodic re-audits and protocol reviews
   - Update formal specs and invariants as features evolve
   - Maintain audit logs and anomaly reports for external review

## Deliverables
- Audit reports (internal & external)
- Test and coverage results
- Updated documentation and formal specs
- Public bug bounty and disclosure policy
