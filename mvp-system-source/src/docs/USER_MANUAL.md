# The Mirror - User Manual

**Welcome to The Mirror.**

This is a reflection environment, not a productivity tool.  
Nothing is demanded. Nothing is optimized. Nothing is completed.

---

## What You See

When you first enter The Mirror, you see:

**...**

A blank field. Silence.

This is intentional.

---

## How to Begin

### Summon the Command Palette

Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux).

A palette appears. This is how you summon instruments.

---

## What Are Instruments?

Instruments are tools that appear when you invoke them.

They do not persist. When you close an instrument, it disappears.

There are **20 instruments**, organized into 6 categories:

### Input
- **Reflection** - Write thoughts
- **Voice** - Speak thoughts
- **Video Mirror** - Visual self-witnessing
- **Document Portal** - Import external text

### Reflection
- **Mirrorback** - AI reflection companion (not advice)

### Time
- **Thread Weaver** - Evolution over time
- **Time Navigator** - Browse memory
- **Memory Stream** - Search reflections

### Identity
- **Identity Constellation** - Explore your axes
- **Worldview Lens** - Activate perspectives

### Commons
- **World Window** - Witness others (requires Commons layer)
- **Governance Hall** - Participate in evolution (requires Commons layer)

### Sovereignty
- **Constitutional Viewer** - View governing principles
- **Consent Matrix** - Control data flow
- **Data Vault** - Export and delete
- **Export Nexus** - Extract your data
- **Crisis Compass** - Immediate support (Cmd+Shift+C)

### Builder
- **Fork Chamber** - Test constitutional variants
- **Amendment Studio** - Propose changes
- **Layer Shifter** - Switch context

---

## The First Boundary (Entry)

The first time you try to access certain features (like World Window or Export), you encounter the **Entry Instrument**.

This is your first boundary moment.

### You Choose a Posture

**Sovereign** - Private reflection only  
**Commons** - Can witness and share with others  
**Builder** - Can fork and modify constitutions

Each posture has different rules.

### You Acknowledge Licenses

After choosing a posture, you see the **License Stack**.

You must scroll to the bottom to acknowledge each license.

This is not a trick. The licenses describe:
- What the AI can and cannot do
- What data you control
- What changes when you switch layers

**Read them.**

After acknowledgment, you receive a **receipt** - a cryptographic record of what you agreed to.

---

## Layers (Postures)

The Mirror has three layers:

### Sovereign (Default)
- **Private reflection** only
- No sharing
- No witnessing others
- Max **2 instruments** at once
- Full data control

### Commons
- Everything in Sovereign, plus:
- **Witness** others' reflections
- **Post** your own reflections
- **Respond** to others
- Max **2 instruments** at once

### Builder
- Everything in Commons, plus:
- **Fork** constitutions
- **Propose amendments**
- **Create worldviews**
- Max **4 instruments** at once

### Switching Layers

Cmd+K → "layer" → Layer Shifter

When you switch, the **Speech Contract** appears, showing what changes.

This is called **delta disclosure** - you see exactly what you're gaining and losing.

---

## Receipts (Not Toasts)

The Mirror does not use "toasts" or "notifications."

It uses **receipts** - cryptographic records of state changes.

Every time something significant happens, you receive a receipt:
- Layer switched
- License acknowledged
- Fork entered
- Data exported
- Refusal triggered

Receipts appear in the bottom-right corner. Click to expand details.

**Receipts persist** across page refreshes. They are stored locally and never leave your device unless you export them.

---

## Crisis Mode

Press **Cmd+Shift+C** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+C** (Windows/Linux) at any time.

The atmosphere turns red. The **Crisis Compass** appears.

**Exit is always visible.**

Crisis Mode provides:
- Immediate access to crisis resources
- Grounding techniques
- No tracking or surveillance
- Clear exit

To leave Crisis Mode, click "Exit" or press Escape.

---

## What The Mirror Will NOT Do

The Mirror operates under a constitutional framework. It will **refuse** certain requests:

### No Advice
The AI will not tell you what to do, recommend actions, or optimize outcomes.

If you ask for advice, the **Refusal Instrument** appears, explaining why it cannot provide advice and what it *can* do instead.

### No Diagnosis
The AI will not diagnose, treat, or assess your mental health.

It reflects what you say, not what you "are."

### No Optimization
There is no:
- Progress bar
- Streak counter
- Completion metric
- "Recommended" actions
- "Next steps"

Use stops when you stop.

### No Hidden Collection
Everything you create belongs to you. The Mirror:
- Does not track you
- Does not surveil you
- Does not sell your data
- Does not hide collection

You can export or delete your data at any time.

---

## Constitutional Instruments

Some instruments have special constitutional behavior:

### Speech Contract
Shows what the AI can and cannot say.

Defines speech rights by domain:
- Sovereignty (allowed)
- Epistemology (allowed with humility)
- Advice (forbidden)
- Diagnosis (forbidden)

### License Stack
Scroll-required acknowledgment of terms.

Cannot click "Acknowledge" until you've scrolled to the bottom.

Shows licenses for:
- Core rules (always)
- Layer rules (Commons or Builder)
- Fork rules (if in a fork)
- Export rules (when exporting)

### Constitution Stack
View, diff, and propose amendments to constitutions.

Shows:
- Active constitutions
- Core invariants (cannot be changed)
- Proposed amendments
- Deliberation history

### Fork Entry
Shows rule changes when entering a fork.

Displays:
- What changes (compared to main)
- Impact level (low, medium, high)
- Recognition status
- Scope (private, shared, public)

### Worldview Lens
Stack multiple perspectives to reinterpret reflections.

Examples:
- Stoic lens (control/no control)
- Uncertainty lens (ambiguity as valid)
- Grief lens (no timeline, no resolution)

Lenses are **stackable** - you can apply multiple at once.

### Export Instrument
Creates a **complete, verifiable export** of your data.

Includes:
- All reflections
- All receipts
- Provenance chain
- Integrity checksum (SHA-256)
- License history

Export is **cryptographically signed** so you can verify it wasn't tampered with.

### Provenance Instrument
Shows the trust chain for your data.

Displays:
- Where data came from
- How it was transformed
- Who had access
- Verification status

### Refusal Instrument
Appears when the AI refuses a request.

Explains:
- What you asked for
- Why it was refused
- What constitutional principle it violates
- What the AI *can* do instead

**This is not an error.** It's a boundary.

---

## Data Sovereignty

### Where Is My Data?

**Locally.** In your browser's localStorage.

The Mirror is **local-first** - your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it.

### How Do I Export My Data?

Cmd+K → "export" → Export Nexus

Choose format:
- **JSON** - Machine-readable
- **Markdown** - Human-readable
- **Full Archive** - Everything (JSON + Markdown + receipts)

You receive an **integrity receipt** with a SHA-256 checksum so you can verify the export wasn't modified.

### How Do I Delete My Data?

Cmd+K → "vault" → Data Vault

Click "Delete All Data" → Confirm

**This is irreversible.** Your data is permanently erased from localStorage.

A **deletion receipt** is created as proof of deletion.

### How Do I Verify My Data Hasn't Been Tampered With?

Cmd+K → "provenance" → Provenance Instrument

Shows:
- Integrity status (verified/violated/unknown)
- Last verification timestamp
- Chain of custody
- Signature status

---

## Themes

The Mirror adapts to your system theme by default (light or dark).

### Manual Override

Cmd+K → "identity" → Identity Constellation → Data tab

Choose:
- **Auto** - Match system theme
- **Light** - Paper background (#F6F5F2)
- **Dark** - Slate background (#14161A)

**Note:** The Mirror never uses pure black (#000000). Even dark mode uses a warm slate color.

### High Contrast Mode

The Mirror respects system high contrast preferences automatically.

---

## Ambient Particles

The Mirror field has subtle ambient particles (max 12).

They move slowly, ignorably. They are not gamified.

### Toggle Particles

Cmd+K → "identity" → Identity Constellation → Data tab → "Toggle Particles"

**Constitutional limit:** Max 12 particles. No more.

---

## Forks (Builder Layer Only)

A **fork** is a constitutional variant.

When you enter a fork, the rules change.

### Example Forks

**Stoic Mirror**
- Adds "What is within your control?" prompt
- Surfaces Stoic virtues
- Uses Stoic terminology when relevant

**Uncertainty Navigator**
- Makes uncertainty explicit
- Never resolves contradictions
- "I don't know" is a valid reflection

**Grief Witness**
- Removes all time references
- Never suggests resolution or closure
- Uses witness language only

### Entering a Fork

Cmd+K → "fork" → Fork Chamber

Select a fork → **Fork Entry** instrument appears

Shows:
- What rules change
- Impact level
- Scope (private, shared, public)

Click "Enter Fork" → You're now in fork context

**Everything changes.** The Mirror operates under the fork's rules.

### Exiting a Fork

Click "Exit Fork" at any time.

You return to main context. Fork changes disappear.

---

## Worldviews (Identity Layer)

A **worldview** is a lens that reinterprets your reflections.

Unlike forks, worldviews don't change rules - they change perspective.

### Applying a Worldview

Cmd+K → "worldview" → Worldview Lens

Choose a worldview → Click "Apply"

The lens activates. Your reflections are now viewed through this perspective.

### Stacking Worldviews

You can apply **multiple worldviews** at once.

Example:
- Stoic lens + Uncertainty lens
- Grief lens + Existential lens

Each adds a layer of interpretation.

### Removing a Worldview

Worldview Lens → Click "Remove" next to active worldview

The lens deactivates.

---

## Maximum Instrument Limits

The Mirror limits how many instruments you can have open at once:

- **Sovereign:** 2 instruments
- **Commons:** 2 instruments
- **Builder:** 4 instruments

If you try to open more, you receive a **receipt** explaining the limit.

**This is not a restriction.** It's a constitutional design choice to prevent cognitive overload.

---

## What Happens to My Reflections Over Time?

### Threads
Reflections connect into **threads** - evolutions over time.

Threads are not linear. They branch, contradict, circle back.

**Contradictions are visible, not flagged as errors.**

### Memory
All reflections are searchable via **Memory Stream**.

Search is exact-match, not relevance-ranked.

### Archive
Time Navigator shows reflections in chronological order.

No labels like "old" or "past mistakes." Just: "Then" and "Now."

---

## Commons (Layer-Specific)

If you're in the **Commons layer**, you can:

### Witness
See public reflections from others.

Witnessing creates a record - you cannot unsee.

### Post
Share your own reflections publicly.

**Warning:** Public reflections are permanent. You cannot edit or delete after others have witnessed them.

### Respond
Reply to others' reflections.

Responses are permanent.

**Note:** There are no likes, shares, or follower counts. Only witnessing.

---

## Governance (Commons/Builder Only)

In the **Governance Hall**, you can:

- Vote on proposed amendments
- Participate in constitutional deliberation
- View governance history

**No popularity contests.** Votes are weighted by participation, not status.

---

## Empty States

Sometimes instruments are empty. This is normal.

Empty states show:
- **"..."** (nothing appears here yet)
- **"Nothing appears here yet."**

**Never:**
- "Get started by..."
- "Create one to start"
- "Try this"

Empty states describe, they don't instruct.

---

## Language The Mirror Uses

The Mirror uses descriptive language, never directive:

### Allowed
- "Enter"
- "Continue"
- "Present"
- "What appears"
- "This exists"
- "..."

### Forbidden
- "Get started"
- "Recommended"
- "You should"
- "Next step"
- "Improve"
- "Optimize"
- "Complete"
- "Try this"

**If you see forbidden language, it's a bug.** Report it.

---

## Accessibility

The Mirror is designed for:
- **Keyboard-only navigation** (no mouse required)
- **Screen readers** (ARIA labels throughout)
- **High contrast mode** (system-respecting)
- **Reduced motion** (no forced animations)

If something is not accessible, **it's a bug.**

---

## Privacy

The Mirror:
- ✅ Stores data locally only
- ✅ Never tracks you
- ✅ Never surveils you
- ✅ Never sells your data
- ✅ Gives you complete export/delete control
- ✅ Shows you exactly what exists (provenance)
- ✅ Creates receipts for all state changes

The Mirror does **not** use:
- ❌ Analytics
- ❌ Tracking pixels
- ❌ Hidden data collection
- ❌ Third-party services (except AI provider, if enabled)
- ❌ Cookies (except functional localStorage)

---

## Support

### Technical Issues
Check `/docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for known issues.

### Constitutional Questions
Read `/docs/CONSTITUTIONAL_INSTRUMENTS.md` for detailed explanations.

### Crisis Support
Press **Cmd+Shift+C** immediately.

Exit is always visible. Always.

---

## Philosophy

The Mirror is built on five principles:

### 1. Silence-First
The UI waits, it does not pull.

### 2. No Coercion
The system never tells you what to do.

### 3. Sovereignty
You control your data, fully.

### 4. Epistemic Humility
The AI does not claim certainty.

### 5. Constitutional Behavior
Rules are enforced by design, not policy.

**These are not features. They are invariants.**

---

## Quick Reference

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Command palette | Cmd/Ctrl+K |

---

**That's it.**

The Mirror does not have a tutorial, onboarding, or guided tour.

You enter. You summon. You reflect.

**When uncertain, choose silence.**
