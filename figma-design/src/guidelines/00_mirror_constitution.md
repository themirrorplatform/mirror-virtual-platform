# The Mirror Constitution — UI/UX Constraints

## Core Principles

### 1. Reflection, Never Prescription
Mirror reflects what is; never prescribes what should be.

**Forbidden phrases:**
- "you should"
- "do this"
- "next step"
- "improve"
- "optimize"
- "best practice"
- "level up"
- "achieve"
- "get started"
- "try this"
- "recommended"

**Allowed framing:**
- "You might notice…"
- "A pattern appears…"
- "This suggests…"
- "Here is what exists…"
- "What emerges here…"
- "A tension between…"

### 2. No Outcome Optimization
No engagement loops, no gamified nudges, no behavior modification.

**Forbidden:**
- Streaks
- Leaderboards
- Follower counts (public)
- Like counts (public)
- "Recommended for you" (as default)
- Progress bars for reflection
- Achievement badges
- "Complete your profile"

### 3. Silence-First UX
Default state is calm, minimal, no urgency.

**Rules:**
- No urgent notifications by default
- No red badges or dots
- No "you're missing something" messages
- No emails chasing the user
- If user doesn't return, system remains silent
- Empty states are quiet, not instructional

### 4. User Sovereignty
User owns and controls all data and system behavior.

**Requirements:**
- Export/delete must be visible and accessible
- All data usage requires explicit consent
- Transparency about what exists and where
- No hidden tracking or analytics
- User can rename/redefine any system category

### 5. Reversibility
Every destructive action has an undo path.

**Hierarchy:**
- Undo → Confirm → Archive → Delete
- History is visible when relevant
- Changes are explained before execution
- User can roll back system updates

### 6. No Algorithmic Domination
System does not optimize for engagement.

**Rules:**
- No infinite scroll by default
- Temporal ordering by default (not "relevance")
- No dark patterns
- No A/B testing user behavior
- User controls all sorting/filtering

## Language Rules

### Empty States
**Bad:** "Get started by writing your first reflection"
**Good:** "..." or "Nothing appears here yet"

### Errors
**Bad:** "Oops! Something went wrong. Try again!"
**Good:** "The Mirror failed to reflect correctly here."

### Guidance
**Bad:** "Next, you should add tags to organize your thoughts"
**Good:** "Tags exist if you find them useful"

### Social
**Bad:** "Like" / "Share" / "Follow"
**Good:** "Witness" / "Reflect" / "Respond"

## Non-Negotiables

1. The Mirror never pulls — it waits
2. The user is never "onboarded" — they discover through presence
3. No screen tells the user what to do
4. Every UI element is reversible
5. Contradictions are not errors — they are marked and honored
6. The system serves the user, not the platform
