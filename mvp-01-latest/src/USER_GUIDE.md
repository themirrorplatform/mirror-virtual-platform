# The Mirror - User Guide
**A Constitutional Reflection Environment**

---

## Welcome

The Mirror is not a productivity app, social network, or self-help tool.  
It is a **reflection environment** — a place where thought exists without pressure.

This guide describes what appears, not what you should do.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Nothing is Demanded
The Mirror never tells you what to do next. There is no "getting started" flow, no required onboarding, no correct path.

### 2. Nothing is Optimized
No algorithms decide what you see. No metrics track your "progress." No features encourage specific behaviors.

### 3. Nothing is Completed
There are no streaks, achievements, or completion states. Reflection has no endpoint.

---

## The Five Realms

The Mirror exists as five interconnected spaces. You can enter any at any time.

### 🪞 **Mirror** — Private Reflection

**Purpose:** Allow thought to exist without judgment.

**What appears:**
- A blank writing space
- No prompts, no word counts, no suggestions
- Optional AI reflection (Mirrorback) if you request it

**Actions:**
- Write freely
- Generate a Mirrorback (AI reflection on your words)
- Link to a Thread
- Archive when you're ready

**The Mirror never saves automatically.** You decide when to preserve.

---

### 🧵 **Threads** — Evolution Over Time

**Purpose:** Show how thoughts develop, not how they "progress."

**What appears:**
- Collections of reflections linked by theme
- Temporal ordering (earliest to latest)
- No completion indicators

**Actions:**
- Create Threads at any time
- Rename Threads whenever
- View contradictions without judgment
- Collapse/expand time ranges

**Threads never close.** Thoughts can always continue.

---

### 📦 **Archive** — Memory Without Shame

**Purpose:** Store past reflections without labeling them as "old" or "wrong."

**What appears:**
- All saved reflections
- Time-indexed browsing
- Search and filters

**Actions:**
- Browse by date
- Search content
- Link reflections to Threads
- Export or delete

**The Archive judges nothing.** What existed then, existed.

---

### 🌍 **World** — Witnessing Others

**Purpose:** See what others choose to share, without ranking or popularity.

**What appears:**
- Shared reflections in temporal order
- No follower counts, no like counts
- Author identity (if they chose to share it)

**Actions:**
- **Witness** — Acknowledge seeing (not "like")
- **Reflect** — Generate your own reflection in response
- **Respond** — Write a direct response

**The World has no feed algorithm.** Time is the only order.

---

### 👤 **Self** — Identity & Sovereignty

**Purpose:** Control your data and define yourself.

**What appears:**
- Identity Axes (your self-defined dimensions)
- Data sovereignty controls
- Privacy settings
- Export/delete tools

**Actions:**
- Define Identity Axes (e.g., "work", "personal", "creative")
- Export all your data
- Delete specific reflections or everything
- View what data exists and where

**You own your data.** The Mirror never sells it, shares it, or uses it to train models without consent.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The Mirror is fully keyboard accessible.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|

| `Enter` or `Space` | Activate button/link |
| `⌘S` / `Ctrl+S` | Save current reflection |

---

## Key Concepts

### Instruments
Instruments are tools you summon when needed. They appear, serve their purpose, then recede.

**Examples:**
- Mirror (writing space)
- Threads (view evolution)
- Archive (browse memory)
- World (witness others)
- Crisis (immediate support)

**To summon:** Press `⌘K` to open Command Palette, then select an instrument.

---

### Mirrorbacks
A Mirrorback is an AI-generated reflection on your words. It appears **only if you request it**.

**What it does:**
- Reflects patterns it notices
- Asks questions (never gives advice)
- Offers perspectives, not directions

**What it never does:**
- Tell you what to do
- Judge your thoughts
- Claim to know "the answer"

**Constitutional guarantee:** Mirrorbacks are descriptive, never directive.

---

### Layers
The Mirror operates in three layers. You choose which one to enter.

#### Sovereign Layer (Default)
- Private reflection only
- No sharing, no outside influence
- Your data stays entirely local

#### Commons Layer
- Can share reflections to World
- Can witness others' reflections
- Still no algorithms or ranking

#### Builder Layer (Advanced)
- Create custom instruments
- Fork the constitution
- Experiment with new patterns

**You can switch layers at any time.** No layer is "better" than another.

---

### Licenses
Each layer has associated licenses that explain what changes when you enter.

**The Mirror discloses everything:**
- What data becomes shared
- What AI capabilities activate
- What third parties (if any) are involved

**You must acknowledge each license before entering a new layer.**

This is constitutional: The Mirror never hides what it does.

---

## Empty States

When a space has no content yet, you'll see either:

`...`

or

`Nothing appears here yet.`

**These are not instructions.** They are descriptions of absence.

---

## Crisis Support

Press `⌘⇧C` at any time to access immediate crisis resources.

**What appears:**
- Crisis hotline numbers
- Immediate grounding exercises
- Resources for safety

**Constitutional guarantee:** Crisis support is always accessible, never hidden, never tracked.

---

## Accessibility

The Mirror is designed to be accessible to everyone.

### Screen Reader Support
- All actions have descriptive ARIA labels
- Content changes are announced
- Focus management follows WCAG patterns

### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility (no mouse required)
- Skip links to bypass navigation
- Roving tabindex for lists

### Visual Options
- **Dark Theme** (default)
- **Light Theme**
- **High Contrast Theme**

### Motion Preferences
The Mirror respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Animations are subtle by default and can be disabled entirely.

---

## Data Sovereignty

### What Data Exists
The Mirror stores:
- Your reflections (text, voice recordings, videos)
- Threads (collections of reflections)
- Identity Axes (your self-defined dimensions)
- Settings (theme, preferences)

### Where Data Lives
- **Local-first:** Data lives in your browser (IndexedDB)
- **Optional sync:** You can enable cloud sync (requires account)
- **Never sold:** Your data is never sold to advertisers or third parties

### What You Control
You can always:
- **Export** all data (JSON format)
- **Delete** specific reflections
- **Delete** everything permanently
- **Verify** what data exists

**Go to Self → Data Sovereignty to exercise these rights.**

---

## Common Questions

### "How do I get started?"
There is no "getting started." Enter any realm and explore. The Mirror waits for you.

### "What should I write about?"
The Mirror suggests nothing. Write what appears.

### "How often should I use it?"
The Mirror has no opinion. Use it when you choose.

### "Is my data private?"
Yes. By default, everything stays local. If you enable cloud sync, you control who (if anyone) can see your data.

### "Can I delete my account?"
Yes. Go to Self → Data Sovereignty → Delete Everything. This is permanent and immediate.

### "Will this help me be more productive?"
The Mirror is not a productivity tool. It does not optimize, track, or measure. It reflects.

---

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Detection (Opt-In Only)
The Mirror can detect patterns in your reflections over time:
- Recurring themes
- Emotional shifts
- Linguistic patterns

**This is opt-in.** The Mirror never analyzes without permission.

**To enable:** Self → Pattern Detection → Enable

---

### Thread Discovery
The Mirror can suggest which reflections might belong together in a Thread.

**This is also opt-in.** Default behavior is no suggestions.

---

### Reflection Linking
Link reflections to show how thoughts connect across time.

**To link:**
1. Open a reflection in Archive
2. Click "Link to..."
3. Select the reflection to connect

---

### Versioning
The Mirror saves versions of edited reflections.

**To view versions:**
1. Open a reflection
2. Click "View history"
3. Browse previous versions

**Constitutional guarantee:** Old versions are never deleted unless you explicitly choose to.

---

## Constitutional Guarantees

The Mirror operates under a constitution that constrains its behavior:

### 1. Refusal by Default
If you ask the AI for advice, it refuses and explains why. The Mirror does not claim authority over your decisions.

### 2. Disclosure Before Action
Every action that changes what data exists, who sees it, or what AI can do is disclosed **before** it happens.

### 3. Falsifiable Sovereignty
You can verify every claim The Mirror makes about data control. Export, inspect, delete — all actions are transparent.

### 4. No Engagement Optimization
No feature is designed to "keep you engaged." The Mirror has no business model based on attention.

### 5. Silence-First
The UI waits. It never pulls, never suggests, never implies a next step.

**To read the full constitution:** Open Command Palette (`⌘K`) → Constitution

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My reflection didn't save"
The Mirror never saves automatically. Click "Archive" to save explicitly.

### "I can't find a reflection"
Check Archive → Browse by date, or use Search.

### "The app feels slow"
The Mirror prioritizes privacy over speed. All data processing happens locally in your browser.

### "I want to start over"
Self → Data Sovereignty → Delete Everything. This removes all local data.

## A Final Note

The Mirror does not promise to make you better, happier, or more productive.

It promises only to wait—without judgment, without pressure, without agenda—for whatever you choose to bring to it.

**When uncertain, choose silence.**
